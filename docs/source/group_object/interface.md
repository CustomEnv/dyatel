# Group Interface

```{warning}
The following link presents auto-generated interface documentation for the abstract `Element` class. 

This documentation is essential because it provides a comprehensive overview of all available methods for the `Element` and `Group` objects as well.

For the actual method signatures, please refer to the `mops.base.group.Group` class.
```

The `Group` class is a fundamental building block for creating Page Object Models (POM) in web testing. 
It provides a comprehensive set of methods, identical to the `Element` class. 

**Refer to the {doc}`Element Interface <../element_object/interface>` for available APIs.**
