# Element Interface

```{warning}
This is auto-generated interface documentation for the abstract `Element` class. 

This is essential for providing a comprehensive overview of all available methods for the `Element` object.

For the actual signature, please refer to `dyatel.base.element.Element`.
```


```{note}
All of these methods will work in the same way for `Group` class instances, which represent a collection of elements. 
```

The `Element` class is a fundamental building block for creating Page Object Models (POM) in web testing. 
It provides a comprehensive set of methods that allow you to interact with various web page elements which be found below.
